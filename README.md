Full Stack Individual Project - Pokemon

## Project Objectives
This app was built using React, Redux, Node and Sequelize.
Affirm and connect the concepts learned.
Learn best practices.
Learn and practice the GIT workflow.
Use and practice testing.

## Description
With this app you can check out 40 different pokemons from the **pokeapi**. You can search for pokemons by name, filter and sort them. You can also create your own new pokemon. 

**IMPORTANT:** For the filtering and sorting functionalities, you can NOT use the external API endpoints that already return the filtered or sorted results, but you must do it yourself. In particular, some of the sorting or filtering must be done from the frontend.

## Only Endpoints/Flags that can be use
GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon
GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id}
GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name}
GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type

## Minimum requirements
The minimum requirements for the approval of the individual project will be detailed below. Those who want to add more functionality will be able to do so. As for the visual design, there will be no predetermined wireframes or prototypes, but they will have the freedom to do it as they like, but they will have to apply the knowledge of styles seen in the course so that it is pleasing to the eye.

**IMPORTANT:** It will not be allowed to use external libraries to apply styles to the application. They will have to use CSS with some of the options that we saw in that class (pure CSS, CSS Modules or Styled Components)
